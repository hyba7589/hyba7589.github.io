    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>Queen is a popular rock band that formed in 1970. They formed in London, England. Their vocalist was Freddie Mercury, their 
        guitarist was Brian May, and their drummer was Roger Taylor. Brian May and Roger Taylor also served as backing vocalists. 
        They had several different bassists before they stuck with John Deacon. They are best known for their massive hit songs, 
        including Bohemian Rhapsody, We Will Rock You, Don't Stop Me Now, Killer Queen, and many more. The band went on until 1991, 
        when singer Freddie Mercury tragically passed away from bronchopneumonia while suffering from AIDS. To this day, they are one 
        of the best selling bands in the world. Their legacy lives on with Brian May and Roger Taylor now performing with singer Adam 
        Lambert as Queen+Adam Lambert. Many musicians around the world often cite Queen as one of their influences, across all genres 
        from pop to metal.
